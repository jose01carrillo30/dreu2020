Continued on crash course and spectated a peer review.

This week I continued on the crash course, and should be nearing the end of it.

I also participated in a paper review; specifically, I read the paper, and then discussed about it with the other members of the group. Since I am still on-boarding, I did not write out a review and submit it like my mentors did, but instead was there to see what the process looks like. The paper, *Mobile Robot Path Planning in Dynamic Environments through Globally Guided Reinforcement Learning*, was very interesting to me. It described a method to use Machine Learning to locally plan around moving obstacles and traditional motion planning to create a global plan around static obstacles.
