As suggested by my mentor Irving on Wednesday afternoon, I went back to the Expansive Spaces Tree (EST) to implement it in PMPL, which I had skimmed over in the crash course. It is almost completed, just need to add the code which randomly selects which node to expand and maybe do some clean up. I took off Friday for Independence Day, so instead I should complete this by Monday.

I read "Interaction Templates for Multi Robot Systems" which is past work in my mentor's group, and is highly related to my current project. I also skimmed some other papers to try and get a better grasp on the problem and potential solutions. These skimmed papers included

- Sampling-based algorithms for optimal motion planning by Karaman et. al.
- Multi-Robot Task and Motion Planning With Subtask Dependencies by Motes et. al.
- Scalable Asymptotically-Optimal Multi-Robot Motion Planning by Dobson et. al.
- Direct-DDRT*: A RRT Improvement Proposal by Coelho et. al.
- Maybe a couple more I don't remember off the top of my head

Next week I am planning to work with my mentor to get more familiar with the existing MAMP, Interaction template, and local repair code.
