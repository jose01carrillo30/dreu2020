Project selection, crash course conclusion

This week I attended the showcase of potential projects and the office hours of several mentors to ask questions and see which is the best fit for me.
There were several projects pitched there that were interesting to me, but I decided to work with Irving on Local Repair planner. Since these were presented on Friday, I will probably begin working with him on Monday.

For the rest of this week, I worked on the crash course. It is almost complete, I am planning to finish the last part this weekend.
