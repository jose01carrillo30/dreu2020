Presentation and CAT implementation

This week I mostly worked on creating a video presentation for this project. My mentor gave me some feedback on various things I should add, especially in the background section. I submit the video to be posted on the DREU website. Afterwords, I also received feedback from the rest of my research group about the presentation. From this I decided to work on making more graphics to help with the weak points of my presentation, one of which I've added to this website.

I worked a little bit on the template placement code. I can now perform transformations too, but I still need to do more before that placement algorithm is done.
