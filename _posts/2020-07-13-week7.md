How Conflict Avoidance Templates (CATs) are implemented, trying to figure out how to place them

This week I generated ideas on how conflict avoidance templates (CATs) can be placed. Part of this was in discussing, expanding on these with Irving and James, as well getting new ones. We also discussed what existing code might be considered or utilized for this. Irving and I begun preliminary steps of implementing the code. I did another pass reading over "Optimal and Bounded-Suboptimal Multi-Agent Motion Planning", but should probably revisit this in the future to fully understand it. Next week I am planning to continue implementing CAT placement and related pre- and postprocessing, and start creating the LaTeX document for this project's report in order to centralize my documentation so far.
