XMLs, presentation animations as explanations.

This week I started to get more familiar with MAMP code; played around with the .env and .xml files. This will help me both with debugging, and with generating outputs to be used in presentations. I also gained a better understanding of what the project this summer entails and put together a rough timeline for it with my mentor. I looked into a paper similar to what my mentor is individually working on, which isn't directly related to my summer project but does have relevance. Lastly, I put together a presentation to showcase what my summer project is to other members of the lab, but this was postponed. The GIFs I made then are now on this sites home page. Following the timeline, next week I will begin working on the preprocessing part of the project. I also would like to further read the aforemention relevant paper, "Optimal and Bounded-Suboptimal Multi-Agent Motion Planning" by Cohen, Uras, Kumar, & Koenig.
