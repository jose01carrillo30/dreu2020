Algorithms, implementation, and TeX.

I worked on creating a couple pseudocode algorithms for placing templates in the environment we are working with. One of these algorithms is for when rotation of the robot is a small contribution to the distance metric and is simpler, while the other is more general but has some black-box functions that will need to be explored. Both of these are designed so that the safe edges will be the same length, which gets around the problem of how to handle robots arriving at the template at different times.

I also worked on template placement code. In its current state, it is able to add the template to the respective robot's roadmaps when in conflict, and should soon be able to perform transformations on these points.

Lastly, I began to create a basic LaTeX document with early draft project description and some introduction topics to be covered. All of my documentation has been a bit scattered so far, so hopefully this will consolidate it into one place.

Next week, I plan to:
• Create code to allow templates to be transformable and check validity w.r.t. static objects where we are pasting.
• Implement one of the algorithms for placing the templates.
• Create my presentation for the research showcase for this program.
