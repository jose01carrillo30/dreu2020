This week I worked on the on-boarding crash course, which introduced Probabilistic Road Maps (PRMs). I also created this website from the Jekyll Template DREU provided. I helped perform a literature survey in preparation for our meeting with Dr. Viktor Gruev, and attended the meeting. Gruev and his team work on creating polarization imaging sensors, and were looking into applications of them that are related to our teamâ€™s past work. Afterwards I did a bit of reading on the physics of light polarization so I can be more useful in future discussions with them.
